# GPT-4 Academic Advisor Implementation Plan

### instructions for AI
- keep going until the job is completely solved before ending your turn
- use your tools and don't guess
- plan thoroughly before every tool call
- if you are not sure about file content or codebase structure, open them - do not hallucinate
- you MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the output of the previous function call
- ALWAYS read existing files first to understand current structure before making changes
- Execute implementation phases in exact order specified
- Test each phase before moving to next
- Validate existing functionality remains intact after each change


## üéØ Objective
Add a GPT-4 powered conversational academic advisor to the existing AI Academic Advisor POC as a modular feature that enhances but does not replace current functionality.

## üèõÔ∏è University Context Requirements
- AI advisor must operate as "Dr. Sarah Chen" from "Metropolitan University"
- Must reference specific courses from mockData.ts (CS101, STAT201, etc.)
- Must be aware of university policies (120 credit requirement, GPA thresholds)
- Must integrate with existing risk assessment and recommendation systems
- Must maintain institutional authenticity for stakeholder demos

## üìã Implementation Phases

### üîç Phase 0: Pre-Implementation Analysis (REQUIRED FIRST)
**MUST DO BEFORE ANY CODING:**
1. Read and understand existing file structure:
   - `app/lib/types.ts` - Current type definitions
   - `app/lib/mockData.ts` - Student and course data structure
   - `app/lib/academicAdvisorService.ts` - Existing service methods
   - `app/page.tsx` - Current tab structure and navigation
   - `app/globals.css` - Existing styling patterns
2. Verify existing API endpoints in `/api/` directory
3. Understand current component architecture in `/components/`
4. Document current tab IDs: ['risk', 'recommendations', 'prerequisites', 'progress', 'pathways']

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
**Prerequisites:** Complete Phase 0 analysis

**Step 1.1: Create GPT Advisory Service**
- File: `app/lib/gptAdvisoryService.ts`
- Dependencies: Import existing types, mockData, and AcademicAdvisorService
- Required functions:
  ```typescript
  - provideAcademicAdvice(studentId: string, question: string)
  - createStudentProfileFromFreeForm(input: string)
  - getUniversityContext()
  ```

**Step 1.2: Create API Endpoint**
- File: `app/api/gpt-advisor/route.ts`
- Must handle POST requests with student context
- Error handling for missing OpenAI key
- Integration with gptAdvisoryService

**Step 1.3: Create Chat Component**
- File: `app/components/UniversityAdvisorChat.tsx`
- Props: `{ selectedStudent: string }`
- Features: Message history, typing indicator, suggested questions
- Styling: Consistent with existing components

### Phase 2: Type System Enhancement
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 complete and tested

**Step 2.1: Extend Type Definitions**
- File: `app/lib/types.ts` (MODIFY CAREFULLY)
- Add new interfaces:
  ```typescript
  interface AdvisorMessage {
    role: 'student' | 'advisor';
    content: string;
    timestamp: Date;
  }
  
  interface AdvisorSession {
    studentId: string;
    messages: AdvisorMessage[];
    sessionId: string;
  }
  ```

**Step 2.2: Optional Mock Data Enhancement**
- File: `app/lib/mockData.ts` (OPTIONAL)
- Add sample advisor sessions for demo purposes

### Phase 3: UI Integration
**Prerequisites:** Phases 1-2 complete, all existing functionality verified intact

**Step 3.1: Update Main Page**
- File: `app/page.tsx` (CRITICAL - PRESERVE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY)
- Current tabs array: `[risk, recommendations, prerequisites, progress, pathways]`
- ADD new tab: `{ id: 'advisor', label: 'AI Advisor Chat', icon: 'ü§ñ' }`
- Import new UniversityAdvisorChat component
- Add conditional rendering for 'advisor' tab

**Step 3.2: Add Chat Styling**
- File: `app/globals.css`
- Add chat-specific styles that match existing design system
- Ensure consistency with current component styling

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (OPTIONAL)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 3 complete, full demo testing successful

**Files to Create:**
- `app/components/AdvisorSessionHistory.tsx` - Session management
- `app/components/StudentProfileCreation.tsx` - Enhanced onboarding

## üîß Technical Specifications

### University Context Data Structure
```typescript

  minimumGPA: 2.0,
  maxCreditsPerSemester: 18,
  currentSemester: "Fall 2025"
};
```

### GPT-4 System Prompt Structure
```typescript

2. Verify existing functionality unchanged
3. Test AI responses include university-specific context
4. Validate all tabs work correctly

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Safety Measures

### Before ANY Changes
1. **BACKUP STRATEGY**: Read and document existing functionality
2. **INCREMENTAL CHANGES**: Implement one file at a time
3. **VALIDATION**: Test after each file creation/modification
4. **ROLLBACK PLAN**: Know how to revert if something breaks

### Red Flags - STOP Implementation If:
- Any existing API endpoint stops working
- Any existing component throws errors
- Student selection dropdown breaks
- Navigation between existing tabs fails
- TypeScript compilation errors on existing files

### Emergency Rollback
If any existing functionality breaks:
1. Remove newly created files
2. Revert modifications to existing files
3. Restore original tabs array in page.tsx
4. Test all existing functionality
5. Restart implementation from Phase 0

### Safe Modification Patterns
```typescript
// ‚úÖ SAFE: Adding new items to arrays
const tabs = [...existingTabs, newTab];

// ‚úÖ SAFE: Adding new properties to interfaces
interface Student {
  // ...existing properties...
  newProperty?: string; // Optional to maintain compatibility
}

// ‚ùå DANGEROUS: Modifying existing properties
interface Student {
  id: number; // Changed from string - BREAKS EXISTING CODE
}

// ‚ùå DANGEROUS: Removing or renaming existing exports
export { NewName as OldName }; // Breaks imports
```
